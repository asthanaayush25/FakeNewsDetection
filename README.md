# FakeNewsDetection

## The objective of this project is to show how NLP works by using TF-IDF.

### Logistic Regression is used for classification function.

### A new feature "content" is built by combinig "author" and "title" since it is a better marker to tell weather a news is fake or real than the two features being used separately.
